# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: 自动触发更新

# 代码 push 到 master 分支的时候运行该 workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # node 打包生成静态文件
  build-and-push:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: fasle # false 是用 personal token，true 是使用 GitHub token
          fetch-depth: 0 # 保证能够 push 成功

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
